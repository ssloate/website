## Improving Maternal Care for Pregnant Women in North Carolina's Jails

<b> Background</b> <p>

Pregnant persons in county jails are a vulnerable population who face barriers to receiving proper maternal care. Yet, providing quality healthcare before, during and after pregnancy is especially important for these persons to ensure their unique needs are met and their children are healthy. <p>

However, information on the prevalence of pregnant persons in jail and on jail policies is scarce. While the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists outlines  <a href="[https://www.aclu.org/state-standards-pregnancy-related-health-care-and-abortion-women-prison-0](https://www.aclu.org/state-standards-pregnancy-related-health-care-and-abortion-women-prison-0. "https://www.aclu.org/state-standards-pregnancy-related-health-care-and-abortion-women-prison-0.")"> <b>maternal health standards for incarcerated persons </b> </a>, North Carolina has few state laws regulating this care and leaves jail policy to the discretion of each county.

<b> My Work</b> <p>

Myself and a team of Duke Public Policy Master's students are partnering with the <a href="[https://www.mombaby.org/north-carolina-perinatal-health-incarceration-working-group/](https://www.mombaby.org/north-carolina-perinatal-health-incarceration-working-group/ "https://www.mombaby.org/north-carolina-perinatal-health-incarceration-working-group/")">North Carolina Perinatal Health and Incarceration Working Group</a> to understand and improve the health and well-being of pregnant incarcerated women and their children in North Carolina. This research project will inform the Working Group’s plan for improving maternal care in jails by answering the following policy question: <p> <i>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What steps should the Working Group take to improve maternal care and transition services for pregnant women in North Carolina’s county jails? </i><p>

By May 2021, my team will research existing North Carolina legislation, review the state’s policies, examine case studies of quality maternal programs throughout the U.S., perform qualitative stakeholder interviews, and analyze quantitative descriptive statistics. Ultimately, we will produce a survey analysis of current maternal care in North Carolina’s jails, a landscape analysis of quality maternal care practices in prisons and jails nationwide, and a final report that offers policy, advocacy, and legislative recommendations to improve maternal care in North Carolina’s county jails.

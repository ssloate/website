  title: A Bit About Me
  description: Public Policy Student and Data Enthusiast
  content: |-
    I'm at Duke University's <b><a href="https://www.sanford.duke.edu">Sanford School of Public Policy</a> </b> getting my Master's degree. With it, I'm going to improve social and economic programs using an interdisciplinary, data-driven approach. Before Duke, I worked as a federal contractor on workforce and anti-poverty programs.

    If I'm not thinking about the social policy or civic tech, I'm probably baking, doing the New York Times crossword, or somewhere outdoors.
